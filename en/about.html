                <img src="../images/moa-weaving.jpg" alt="Moa weaving a shawl" class="page-image">
                <p>My journey with weaving began when I was expecting my first child. I wanted to create something beautiful and functional that would help me carry my baby close to my heart.</p>
                <p>Each shawl is handwoven in my Gothenburg studio using natural, sustainable materials. I carefully select every thread to ensure both beauty and durability.</p>
                <p>The patterns I create are inspired by Scandinavian nature and the changing seasons. Many of my designs also incorporate symbols of the values I hold dear - equality, diversity, and environmental consciousness.</p>
                <p>When you purchase a shawl from me, you're not just getting a baby carrier - you're getting a piece of wearable art that's been created with love and intention.</p>
